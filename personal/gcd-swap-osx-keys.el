;;; Commentary:

;; Since the Alt/Option key is not used in OS X anywhere as often as the
;; Command key, we should also reflect this in Emacs where the Super key
;; is used nowhere near as much as the Meta key.

;;; Code:
(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-option-modifier 'super)

(provide 'gcd-swap-osx-keys)
